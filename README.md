- "Over time, I've learned that trying to get an abstraction right the first time is like premature optimization--until you can make decisions based on real usage patterns, your early guesses are liable to be off. Allowing a bit of CopyAndPasteProgramming can add interesting diversity to the gene pool, resulting in a better basis for selecting out winning abstractions."

- Then, in DontRepeatYourself, RalphJohnson wrote: ... "it is often better to wait til you have several examples of the duplication so you can better see how to eliminate it."
